# sign-up-form

Validate the included form (form.html) client side for the following:
- The following are required fields: contest1_name, first_name, country, email, birth_day, birth_month, birth_year, privacy_check
- Validate that the email address is the correct email format
- Validate that the user is older than 14 years old based on the current date

Considerations for task 1:
- Are there any improvements you could make to the way the form works?
- Your validation code must run on client side .html page only.

Deliverable: set up a working example of the form, either online for us to look at, or locally on a machine to bring and show us.
